## The problem

I've got several freelance clients.  There's no doubt that I'm on my way out of freelancing, but keeping a few existing clients would be a good way to keep up with best practices, etc and be able to implement them on a smaller scale.

The problem is all of the clients have websites built a different way.  As I've learned more, each new client is sort of a pinnacle of my current knowledge.  I keep changing things (markup, naming conventions, build tools, CMS, etc) which is great, but I've never gone back and added those new "best practices" to older sites.

I've since realized that this is a terrible way to build long-living, maintainable websites and it's a huge reason for my frustration with working with these clients and sites.

Some of these frustrations and/or pain-points are client-driven, but the majority of problems point back to me and my lack of project management skills.  Specifically:

* An inability to define and clear the scope upfront 
* Setting no expectations and goals.
* Lack of trust in working with other people. 
* Poor time estimates and billing.
* Lack of communication in general.
* Overthinking the solution to try an create something that a feel is "great", instead of focusing on the clients goals (which are never clearly defined in the first place).

Ouch.  What a list.  Here's a quote that sums it up:

> You don't need to pay a web-designer to develop a site that's incredibly fancy (and whose main value is that it's a monument to his skills).

I don't remember where I read that, but it hit hard and really got me thinking.
